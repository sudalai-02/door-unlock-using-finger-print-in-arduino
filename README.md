# Fingerprint-Based Door Unlocking System Using Arduino

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a fingerprint-based door unlocking system using an Arduino microcontroller. The system employs a fingerprint sensor to authenticate users and control an electronic lock, offering a secure and convenient method for access control.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Uno**: The main microcontroller that processes data and controls the system.
- **Fingerprint Sensor (R 307 )**: Captures and processes fingerprint data.
- **Electronic Lock or Servo Motor**: Acts as the locking mechanism for the door.
- **Relay Module**: Controls the electronic lock based on signals from the Arduino.
- **Power Supply**: Provides the necessary power for the Arduino and other components.
- **Connecting Wires and Breadboard**: For making connections between components.
- **Optional: LCD Display**: For user interface and status updates.

## Features

- **Fingerprint Registration**: Allows the user to register new fingerprints for access.
- **Fingerprint Verification**: Authenticates fingerprints to unlock the door.
- **Access Logs**: (Optional) Records and displays the time of access.
- **Status Indication**: (Optional) Provides visual feedback (e.g., LED or LCD display).

## Circuit Diagram

A detailed circuit diagram is provided in the `circuit_diagram.pdf` file. Key connections include:
- **Fingerprint Sensor** to Arduino (TX/RX pins)
- **Relay Module** to Arduino (Digital I/O pins)
- **Electronic Lock** to Relay Module
- **Power Supply** to Arduino and Relay Module

## Installation

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the fingerprint sensor to the Arduino according to the circuit diagram.
   - Connect the relay module to the Arduino and the electronic lock.
   - Ensure the power supply is connected properly.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the necessary Arduino libraries for the fingerprint sensor.
   - Upload the provided Arduino code (`FingerprintDoorUnlock.ino`) to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

3. **Fingerprint Enrollment**:
   - Follow the instructions in the code or documentation to enroll new fingerprints.

4. **Operation**:
   - Place a registered fingerprint on the sensor to unlock the door.
   - The system will verify the fingerprint and control the relay to unlock the door if the fingerprint is authenticated.

## Code

The Arduino code is included in the repository as `FingerprintDoorUnlock.ino`. The code handles:
- Initialization of the fingerprint sensor.
- Enrollment of new fingerprints.
- Verification of fingerprints during access attempts.
- Control of the relay to unlock the door.
